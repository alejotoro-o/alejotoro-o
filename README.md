### About me

I am a Mechatronic Engineer with an M.Sc. in Engineering, specializing in intelligent systems and automation. I am passionate about research in robotics, artificial intelligence, and control systems. In addition to this research, I'm also passionate about web development.

Throughout my career, I’ve contributed to diverse research projects, from designing control systems and applying machine learning to soft robotics, to developing bioinspired prosthetics and exoskeletons. Currently, I’m exploring control laws for multi-agent systems, aiming to enhance coordination and autonomy in distributed robotic networks.
